# Password Generator

## Task

For this weeks homework, I was to modify starter code to create a password generator. Using Javascript, I had to prompt a user for information and then display a randomized sequence of characters based on their inputs.

## Screenshot of Application

## Acceptance Criteria 

According to the user story, my application needed to:

Start the password generation process when I hit the "generate password" button

Show a prompt allowing user to input their desired password length (from 8-128 characters)

Have user confirm what types of characters they want in their password 

Validate there was at least one input critera selected before moving on

When all prompts are answer, generate password either in alert or written to page

## Unsolved Issues

## Resolved Issues

Alert added to warn user they did select any character types

Rewrote generateCharacters function to not be a giant if / else if / else if monstrosity.
